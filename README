Assuming that you need to program and use the multivalue database then you need to install PostgreSQL and a C++ compiler.

Linux/Mac

If you install Postgres after Exodus then you will have to run inslibs.sh in Exodus' application folder
to add Exodus' Postgres plugin (pgexodus) to the Postgres package library folder.

Mac

Postgres binaries are available from postgresql.org

xcode should be installed from the operating system cd's utilities folder.
