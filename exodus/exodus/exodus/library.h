//called like a function or subroutine from another executable.

//by including the libraryfilename.h file name in other programs and libraries.
//the libraryinit() libraryexit() macros would have to modified to create function names
//eg libraryinit(funcx) libraryexit(funcx)

//a library can also have classes. classes are identical to library sections but they are
//private to the library since they are not published in the libraryfilename.h file.

//and are redefined without DLLEXPORT here

//a library section is just a class plus a global exported function that allows the class
//to be instantiated and its main(...) called from another program via so/dll delay loading
//AND share the mv environment variables of the calling program!

//Interestingly, Exodus up to subversion version 129 worked fine without this but I wasnt able to detect what
//complexity had been added that caused MS to optimise and break mfp compatibility
//warning C4158: assuming #pragma pointers_to_members(full_generality, virtual_inheritance)
#pragma warning (disable: 4158)
#pragma pointers_to_members( full_generality )

//the above requirement could be removed if libraryexit() generated the exactly
//correct pointer to member WITH THE RIGHT ARGUMENTS
//this could be done by generating special code in funcx.h and requiring
//#include "funcx.h" in the bottom of every "funcx.cpp"
